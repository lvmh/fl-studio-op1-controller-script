# fl-studio-op1-controller-script by HS

A fixed & improved on version of the now defunct: https://github.com/ryrun/FL-OP1-controller-script

It adds support for the transport control functions like ***Play***, ***Stop***, ***Record*** and ***Metronome***.

## Additional button mappings:

* Drum button = Open FL Channel rack
* Tape button = Open FL Playlist
* Mixer button = Open FL Mixer
* Synth button = Open Piano Roll
* Help Button = Mute Selected track (mixer & channels)
* Click Orange Knob = Solo Selected track (mixer & channels)
* Turn Orange Knob = Adjust volume for selected track (mixer & channels)

## Install

Simply download the python file "device_OP-1.py" and copy it to the folder "Documents\Image-Line\FL Studio\Settings\Hardware\OP-1" (create the op-1 folder if you need to).

After restart of FLStudio, it should be visible as `**HS OP-1 CONFIG** (user)` in MIDI / controller type.
